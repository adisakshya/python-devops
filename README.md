## What is DevOps?

DevOps is the combination of software development and operations. This practice allows a single team to handle the entire application lifecycleâ€”from development, to testing, to deployment, and operations. DevOps helps reduce the disconnect between software developers, quality assurance engineers (QA), and system administrators.

## Python for DevOps

Python is one of the primary technologies used by teams practicing DevOps. Its flexibility and accessibility make Python a great fit for this job, enabling the whole team to build web applications, data visualizations, and to improve their workflow with custom utilities.

That's the reason why I decided to learn DevOps set of practices using python to automate the process between software development & IT teams, in order to build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.
